### Overview
  I will be designing an app to track the improvements of race times for mario kart players. The players will navigate to a website where they will be able to create a user account, login and logout. It won't show anything accept for the navigation bar for those who are not logged in. If the players try to click on a navigation link, it won't do anything. Once the player creates an account and logs in, they can add a new entry, sort by a specified column, list all entries or search all columns for a specified term. Once they click on add entry, the page redirects to a new path. In this new page, they can enter the date that they completed a particular race, their CC speed level, the car they raced in, the characteristics of that car, the character they used in the race, their finishing time, what place they finished at and whether the time went up or down or stayed the same from the previous days entry. 

  Users might find useful that players can track their progress for improvements on mario kart. Users might also find useful that they can prepare for upcoming gaming competitions better. They might also be able to better track stats for specific cars and players, like which car is the fastest, which character is the best, which tires are the best, and more. I came up with the idea for this app because I really enjoy video games and thought it would be neat and beneficial to track improvements for video games. I chose mario kart as a specific video game to track improvements, because it is the best and easiest game to write code for and to track improvements for.
### Features
User authentication: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Search: Users will be able to search the table for mario kart race entries containing given text
Add entry: Users will be able to create new race entries for each set of racs they do each day once logged in. New entries will appear in the table.
Sort: Users will be able to sort by a specific column, either increasing numerically or alphabetically.
### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Thymeleaf Templates
HTML/CSS
### What I'll Have to Learn
I might have to learn how to get your app to send an email to someone to request them to become my friend in the app and add entries themselves. I might also have to learn how to redirect someone to a mario kart website to get extra tips on playing better. I could also learn how to create my project using maven instead of gradle.
